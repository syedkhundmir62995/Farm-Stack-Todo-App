# Farm-Stack-Todo-App

#### This application has been created as a learning tool to acquaint myself with the FARM stack's logic, syntax, control flow, and architecture. 

#### To begin, I worked on the backend to create APIs using FastAPI and Mongodb, and then I moved on to the frontend using React. Furthermore, I integrated the frontend and backend to create a fully functional app. 

#### Add Todo, Delete Todo, Update Todo, Search Todo, Extract Todos, and Completed Todo are the six CRUD operations that I have implemented employing FARM Stack in this project.
